# Gameplay

You control a teapot, and must hit other teapots with your spout, without being hit by their spout.

If you hit them without being hit, you win a point. If you both hit each other with your spouts, it's a draw.

But wait, teapots are magical creatures who can't see for themselves, and can only see thing from the perspective of other teapots!
